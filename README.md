# ocp-docker-s3-fuse

This is a simple project that contains that demonstrates how to use the [FUSE based file system backed by Amazon S3 Bucket](https://github.com/s3fs-fuse/s3fs-fuse) inside of a Fedora based, Docker Container.

## Acknowledgments

In the best spirit of Open Source software, this is based off of the work of others. Including, but not limited to:

* [FUSE based file system backed by Amazon S3](https://github.com/s3fs-fuse/s3fs-fuse)
* [docker-s3fs](https://github.com/xueshanf/docker-s3fs)
* [alpine-s3fs](https://github.com/rjocoleman/docker-alpine-s3fs)

## Overview

This project contains:

* A trivial `Dockerfile` to build the container
* A `docker-entrypoint.sh` that will run the needed `/usr/bin/s3fs` commands
* A makefile to call the `Dockerfile` and run the container in interactive text mode

### Security Implications/Concerns

> :warning: **There is a non-trivial risk of container escape**: This project contains Dragons!


To run this Docker container in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, one would need to create a new [Security Context Constraint](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.6/admin_guide/manage_scc.html#provide-additional-capabilities) for the container definition to enable the additional Linux Kernel Capability and mount the host FUSE device.

### How to Run

To build the container, run:

```
make build
```

To run the built container in interactive text mode, run the following, specifying appropriate values for `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `S3_ACL`, and `S3_BUCKET`. You can get these by going to the [AWS Security Credentials Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/security_credentials) and creating a new Acces Key:

```
make AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='AK...ZQ' AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='+M...9R' S3_ACL='private' S3_BUCKET='kfrankli-ocp-test' shell
```

You could also call the docker command directly:

```
docker run --cap-add SYS_ADMIN --device /dev/fuse -it -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='AK...ZQ' -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='+M...9R' -e S3_ACL='private' -e S3_BUCKET='kfrankli-ocp-test' kfrankli/rhel7-s3-fuse:latest /bin/bash
```

You can also run the make `build` and `shell` targets with the `all` command

```
make AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='AK...ZQ' AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='+M...9R' S3_ACL='private' S3_BUCKET='kfrankli-ocp-test' all
```

Once it is running you should be able to see the conntents of your mapped S3 bucket under `/var/s3`. E.g.:

```
[root@hal9000 ocp-docker-s3-fuse]# make AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='AK...ZQ' AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='+M...9R' S3_ACL='private' S3_BUCKET='kfrankli-ocp-test' shell
[root@a96fce165a49 /]# cat /var/s3/data.txt
No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than manâ€™s and yet as mortal as his own;
