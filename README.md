# ocp-docker-s3-fuse

This is a simple project that contains that demonstrates how to use the [FUSE based file system backed by Amazon S3 Bucket](https://github.com/s3fs-fuse/s3fs-fuse) inside of a Fedora based, Docker Container.

## Acknowledgments

In the best spirit of Open Source software, this is based off of the work of others. Including, but not limited to:

* [FUSE based file system backed by Amazon S3](https://github.com/s3fs-fuse/s3fs-fuse)
* [docker-s3fs](https://github.com/xueshanf/docker-s3fs)
* [alpine-s3fs](https://github.com/rjocoleman/docker-alpine-s3fs)

## Overview

This project contains:

* A trivial `Dockerfile` to build the container
* A `docker-entrypoint.sh` that will run the needed `/usr/bin/s3fs` commands
* A makefile to call the `Dockerfile` and run the container in interactive text mode

### Security Implications/Concerns

> :warning: **There is a non-trivial risk of container escape**: This project contains Dragons!

To allow the container to run the needed `/usr/bin/s3fs` commands, it will need to be granted elevated privileges by way of enabling extra Linux kernel capabilities and mapping to the host FUSE device. Unfortunately the `/usr/bin/s3fs` commands are performing `mount()` operations that require the highest level Linux kernel capability `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`. With this capability, comes significant rights due to issues with Linux Kernel development and a lack of fine-grained control in capabilities. Enabling this will allow for such potentially malicious things as [modifying the state of the SELinux Linux Security Module inside of the container](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/container-tidbits-adding-capabilities-container).

The container will also need the `--device` option set to allow it to see the Docker host's FUSE device to interact with the S3 Bucket. This could potentially lead to such issues as the development of covert storage channels between containers on the same Docker host.

For further information, please consult:

* [Linux Programmer's Manual: mount](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mount.2.html)
* [Container Tidbits: Adding Capabilities to a Container](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/container-tidbits-adding-capabilities-container)

To run this Docker container in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, one would need to create a new [Security Context Constraint](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/admin_guide/manage_scc.html#provide-additional-capabilities) for the container definition to enable the additional Linux Kernel Capability and mount the host FUSE device. This is due to the fact that Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform does not allow for the running of privileged, root, or extra capability containers by default. This is a deliberate design choice to prevent the risk of container escape.

### How to Run

To build the container, run:

```
make build
```

To run the built container in interactive text mode, run the following, specifying appropriate values for `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `S3_ACL`, and `S3_BUCKET`. You can get these by going to the [AWS Security Credentials Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/security_credentials) and creating a new Acces Key:

```
make AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='AK...ZQ' AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='+M...9R' S3_ACL='private' S3_BUCKET='kfrankli-ocp-test' shell
```

You could also call the docker command directly:

```
docker run --cap-add SYS_ADMIN --device /dev/fuse -it -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='AK...ZQ' -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='+M...9R' -e S3_ACL='private' -e S3_BUCKET='kfrankli-ocp-test' kfrankli/rhel7-s3-fuse:latest /bin/bash
```

You can also run the make `build` and `shell` targets with the `all` command

```
make AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='AK...ZQ' AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='+M...9R' S3_ACL='private' S3_BUCKET='kfrankli-ocp-test' all
```

Once it is running you should be able to see the conntents of your mapped S3 bucket under `/var/s3`. E.g.:

```
[root@hal9000 ocp-docker-s3-fuse]# make AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='AK...ZQ' AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='+M...9R' S3_ACL='private' S3_BUCKET='kfrankli-ocp-test' shell
[root@a96fce165a49 /]# cat /var/s3/data.txt
No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than manâ€™s and yet as mortal as his own;
